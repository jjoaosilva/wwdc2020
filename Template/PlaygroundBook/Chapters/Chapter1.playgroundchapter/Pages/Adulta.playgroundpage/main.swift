 # What's the next step? 🌵💚🧑🏾‍🌾
 
So, now that you have your cactus properly planted, watered and insolated, keep the same care. Cultivation is always beneficial for both sides: while you take care of your cactus, it teaches you to have responsibilities and attention to details, after all it is a life we are talking about!

And why do I love cacti? Because even with my crazy routine, in which I forget to drink water or forget to just stop and enjoy the sun, I know that they will be there firm and strong waiting for the next watering, the next rain and the next sun with optimism and strength !
